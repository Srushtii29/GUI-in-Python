# GUI-in-Python
Created a user interface in python using tkinter library.

In this project, we have created two windows. The first window shows a page "Jobs" in which there are 12 sub-options. On clicking Customer Service, another window opens. In this window you can search for a paticular company and then click on Search button. You can even click on the companies which are given as options. On clicking those, a message box will be displayed. On clicking any other option from the 'Jobs' page, a message box will be displayed.
